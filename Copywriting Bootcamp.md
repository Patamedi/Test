### **Day 1, Monday** - *Empathise & Define*

**Empathise:** 

The first stage of the Design Thinking process is empathising, this is the foundation to gain a deeper understanding of the  problem you are attempting to solve. It needs to _**observe**_ so you can get _**insights(Human Truth)**_. It is your job to use empathy to learn more about the problem and the people who are experiencing it. You need to engage and empathize with humans to understand their experiences and motivations through research, conducting interviews and/or surveys, reading case studies, or even consulting experts. Empathy is defined as “the ability to understand and share the feelings of another”*

- Google is your friend, Google it

**Define:**

You have all the information you need, now it’s time to break it down pay attention to common themes*/

All the information you have gathered will come together to help you make a better sense of what the actual problem is. Which you will then use to formulate what we call a _**problem statement.**_ 

This problem statement, also known as the How Might We..” statement, is critical in leading you to the next step of the process which will be ideating and coming up with possible solutions to the problem. It is important that you remember that, to effectively solve a problem, you must first clearly define it.

<hr>

### **The Challenge**

_**Part 1 - Empathise**_

Unemployment is one South Africa’s biggest problem that seems to not be getting any better, the majority of the country's youth is unemployed and with the pandemic hitting the world it made things worse. Some skills that people have are not in demand anymore with the world changing people are left stranded and unemployable

**Task:**

Empathize with the people to gain insights to this problem, and gather as much information as possible, interview minimum of 4 people and maximum of 6. Put it all together as a presentation no more than 7 slides long (including title slides).

**Presentation:**

- Deadline is at 9:00 the next day. Use Google Slides
- Day 2 Task Briefing at 11:00

**Resources:** (Spend 30 min to an Hour)

- [What Is Design Thinking?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHGN6hs2gZY)

_**Part 2 - Define**_

Now that you have collected all the information you need from the user, and presented it in a clear and easy to understand format, you need to analyse your findings and begin to define the problem.

**Task:**

Analyse your finding and define the problem you have identified using a “How Might We…” statement
Include this into your presentation.

**Presentation:**

Deadline is at 9:00 the next day. Use Google Slides
Day 2 Task Briefing at 11:00

**Resources:**

How Might We statements

<hr>

## **Day 2 + 3, Tuesday + Wednesday** - *Ideate*

**Ideate:** 

Now is time to come up with solutions to solve the problem you’ve defined

You will now go into this step of the process with a clear understanding of the user and their needs, and all your observations analysed and synthesized into a How Might We statement.

Now is the time to identify possible solutions to solve your defined problem. Keep in mind there are hundreds of techniques one could use to ideate, and you will learn which work best for as time goes on. 

The trick, as cheesy as it may sound, is to always keep and open mind and, wait for it… think out of the box! :P

<hr>

**Challenge**

Use various ideation techniques to come up with innovative ideas to solve the problem you have defined.

**Task**

Choose you best 3 ideas and “flesh them out” a little more
Add all of this to your presentation.
All your ideas(solutions) needs to be in a form of an app or a website


**Presentation:**

- Deadline is at 12:00 on Wednesday. Use Google Slides
- Day 4 Task Briefing at 11:00

**Resources:**

- Your brain & Research

<hr>

## **Day 4, Thursday** - *Prototype*

**Protype:**

A prototype, which we also know as an MVP (minimal viable product), is a scaled-down and non-expensive version of your solution. We like to call it “cheap and nasty”. The value of this prototype is to test if your product would actually solve the problem, without the risk of investing resources into production.

A simple cheap as possible version of what the actual product would be will give you an opportunity to put it in the hands of the user and see how the user interacts with it., which is actually the next step of the process known as Testing. This is great for learnings and iterations that can be done quickly and cost-effectively.

By the end of this you will have a better understanding of the challenges of your own solution and how it can be made better.

<hr>

At this point you have picked your best idea and it's time to get into prototyping(Execute) it.

**Task:** 

- Create wireframes of your product(idea) in figma.
- *Will test your product in the presentation so make sure your frame by frame flow is correct from step 1 to the next

**Presentation:**

- Deadline is at 9:00 the next day. Use FIgma.
